            "releaseNotes": "Hey folks. Yes, I know\u2026it's been a while. I've let things go a little stale over here, so I wanted to apologize. You're probably wondering what happened. Well, we had a baby, for one (yes, he's amazing!). With all of the complexities that go along with having a little one and putting food on the table, dedicating the time Pushpin needs has been a tough thing to do, but I really want to make it work going forward.\n\nSo, I'm thinking of doing a little experiment with subscriptions, and I'm hoping you'll be onboard with it. Don't worry, this isn't happening today. I'm just sowing the seed. I realize a lot of you have paid full-price for the app, so I'm thinking of ways to credit you, and/or otherwise reward you for being awesome.\n\nIf you have any thoughts on this, please tap the support button in the app and send me a note. I'm prepared for the good and the bad. Fact is, I want to keep working on Pushpin, and there are so many loyal users out there. But it's hard to make it work unless we make some changes.\n\nNow\u2026to the actual updates:\n\n* Safari View Controller is now enabled by default! To turn it off this, go to browser settings and uncheck \"Use Safari View Controller\".\n* Premium fonts have been made free for everybody. Have also added options to select San Francisco as the default bookmark font.\n* San Francisco is now the default interface font. About time, right?\n* Fixed some issues with following people on Twitter on the about page.\n* Set the minimum iOS version to 10.3. This will make working with the codebase a lot easier going forward.\n* Made some under-the-hood improvements and the app is now only ~7mb! Pushpin saves your bookmarks and your bandwidth!\n* Lots of other random bug fixes and random refactoring. Fun stuff!\n* Removed UserVoice integration.\n\nLastly, if you're a fan of Pushpin, please consider taking a moment to write a nice review. If you've already written a review for a previous version, please resubmit it as the App Store resets reviews with each new update. If you ever have a question, comment, or just want to say hi, send a note over to support@lionheartsw.com and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.",

            "description": "Have you ever had a moment where you remember seeing something on Twitter, but can't quite remember who said it? How about that link you favorited months ago? Twitter search comes up short. What do you do?\n\nWell, Tweet Seeker has got you covered. It was built with one goal in mind, and that was to help you find your long lost tweets\u2014fast.\n\nWith Tweet Seeker, you can...\n\n+ Search your own tweets\n+ Search replies, mentions, likes, and DMs (please read disclaimer below before purchasing).\n+ Like tweets\n+ Save your searches for quick access later\n+ Customize your font (choose from Arial, Avenir, Courier, Futura, George, Gill Sans, Helvetica Neue Light, and Verdana)\n+ Jazz up your experience with a custom color (choose from Blue, Green, Gray, Yellow, or Red)\n+ Open tweets in Safari, Twitter, Tweetbot, or Twitterific.\n+ Flexible URL scheme with x-callback-url support. E.g., tweetseeker://search/[all, tweets, mentions, faves, or dms]?query=[URL-encoded search query]. You can also specify the Twitter username to search in if you have more than one with the optional \"account\" parameter. Specify the \"x-success\" parameter to open another app with a URL scheme after tapping a tweet.\n+ Export Tweet Seeker's full tweet database to your computer to back up your likes or DMs.\n\nIf you'd like to supercharge your Tweet Seeking experience, the following additional pro features are available for purchase.\n\n** Pro Features **\n\n+ Search your Likes\n+ Search your Direct Messages (DMs)\n+ Add and Manage Unlimited Accounts\n+ Import your Twitter Archive to search all of your tweets (see below)\n\n** Search Syntax **\n\nTweet Seeker provides a powerful search syntax. With it, you can find tweets that (queries are in quotes):\n\n+ Mention a certain user: \u201c@tweetseekerapp\u201d\n+ Contain a hashtag: \u201c#wwdc\u201d\n+ Are retweets: just precede your search with \u201crt\u201d. E.g., \u201crt #wwdc\u201d\n+ Are written by a certain user: \u201cfrom:tim_cook\u201d\n+ Contain a link from a certain domain: \u201clink:macstories.net\u201d\n+ Or are any combination of the above, using standard search operators like AND, OR, NOT, \u201c\u2018s, or parentheses: \u201c(link:macstories.org AND #wwdc) OR from:tim_cook\u201d\n+ Are within a date range. \"since:01-01-2014 until:12-31-2014\"\n\nDisclaimer\n\n**PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING**\n\nDue to Twitter API limitations, when the app first syncs, it will only be able to retrieve up to 3200 of your own tweets (unless you import your archive), up to 800 mentions, and up to 200 DMs. However, Tweet Seeker has no limitations on number of tweets, mentions, or DMs after your first sync. If you'd like to search all of your tweets (not including mentions), you can request your Twitter Archive from Twitter.com and import it into the app.",
